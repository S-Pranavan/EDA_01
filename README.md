# EDA_01
## Explore Netflix movie data and perform exploratory data analysis for a production company to uncover insights about movies from a particular decade.
### 📊 Netflix 1990s Movie Analysis
This project involves (EDA) on a dataset containing Netflix titles to derive insights specifically about movies released in the 1990s. The analysis is performed using Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

### 📁 Dataset
File: netflix_data.csv

The dataset includes a variety of metadata about Netflix titles, such as type, title, director, cast, country, date added, release year, duration, genre, and description.

### 🧪 Objective
Analyze Netflix movies from the 1990s to:

Identify the most frequent movie duration during that decade.

Count how many short action movies (less than 90 minutes) were released in the 1990s.

### 📌 Key Results
Most frequent movie duration (1990s): duration minutes

Number of short action movies (duration < 90 mins): short_movie_count

(Exact values are computed in the notebook.)

### 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
Python

Pandas

Matplotlib / Seaborn (if applicable)

Jupyter Notebook

### 📓 Notebook
The full analysis and code can be found in notebook.ipynb.
It includes:

Data cleaning & filtering

Filtering for short action movies

### 🚀 How to Run
Clone the repository.

Ensure Python and required packages (pandas, numpy, etc.) are installed.

Open notebook.ipynb using Jupyter Notebook or any compatible IDE.

Run all cells to reproduce the analysis.

🧠 Additional Notes
The decade filter starts from 1990 and includes up to 1999.
